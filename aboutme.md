#### My name is Zekarias M.

- I am in search of the true meaning of life ... I don't know if I am an existentialist, but I am going to believe *The Myth of Sisyphus* plotted by *Alebert Camus* has answers for my inquiry.

- I'm Ethiopian!

- Enthusiast in the study of linking economics with data science and machine learning...

-  *አቶ በቀለ ገርባን ጨምሮ ተፎካካሪ የፖለቲካ ፓርቲዎች በጠቅላይ ሚኒስትሩ ንግግር ላይ ምን ተሰማቸው?*

What else do you need?

#### My history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my all time favorite movie by Woody Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstructing_Harry) and it will answer **all** your questions.
