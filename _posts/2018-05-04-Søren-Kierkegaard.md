> A few months ago, I took a MOOC from the University of Copenhagen on Søren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony, and the Crisis of Modernity. Leaving aside the pros and cons of MOOC, I present here the central theme of the course from two aspects.  What did Kierkegaard learn from his study of Socrates? And, what is the relevance of the connection between the two philosophers in the modern world?


In investigating the life and works of the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55), the teachings, way of life, and methodology of the great Socrates would be the primary images to be reflected. During his time of the Danish Golden Age, Kierkegaard seems to have taken Socrates seriously as his role model in his life. From his account at the end of his life, Kierkegaard indicated that his task was a Socratic task, and his philosophical works genuinely reveal this self-imposed onus. Kierkegaard has to go back to the ancient Greek philosopher to seek insight into the relativism, subjectivity, and nihilism. These subjects are often considered as the modern world problems.

Among the crucial indicators of his understanding from the study of Socrates is his masterwork, "The Concept of Irony." In The Concept of Irony, we can understand the structure and argumentative strategy of Kierkegaard. We can also identify critical elements of Kierkegaard's sympathy to the character and philosophy of Socrates, what he called Socrates' irony. The Socratic irony usually appears at the beginning of exchanges when Socrates gets his interlocutor to explain to him or give a definition of something. He pretends to be ignorant. By assuming that there must be something he doesn't understand,  he requests additional definitions until the respondent becomes confused and has nothing to say. From this, Socrates realized that it is easy to get people talking when one flattered them for their expertise.

An essential element of the Socratic dialogue for Kierkegaard is what is known as *aporia*. It is his ability to reduce his dialogue partner to the state of *being at a loss*. A good demonstration of both Socrates' Irony and *aporia* is Socrates' encounter with Euthyphro. Socrates brings Euthyphro to a state of *aporia* in the course of the dialogue by asking Euthyphro for a definition of piety. Upon Socrates' cross-examination, both reach on unsatisfactory definitions again and again. In the end, no real explanation or result is achieved. Euthyphro begins to look more and more foolish and lose patience with Socrates. He suddenly reaches the state of what Socrates called *aporia*, and he runs away.

One fundamental aspect of Socrates' dialogue is that he never confronted his interlocutors with the truth. Instead, the real task was to put the interlocutors on the right track where they can reach the truth for themselves. It means that we already have the truth within ourselves except the need for systematic philosophical investigation to bring it out. By this, Socrates believed that his role was like a midwife who only assisted in bringing out the truth. This characteristic of the Socratic Method is called *maieutic* or midwifery.

This *maieutic* exercise is related to the needs to discover a subjective personal truth, a truth for oneself. Like Socrates, Kierkegaard believes that the more profound truth is not the objective one, but rather, the subjective one that lies within. So, it requires an effort, a journey on the part of the seeker. Truth, rather than just being told or accepted based on some authority, should also be internalized. All these Socratic methods profoundly influenced the young Kierkegaard, and he tried to follow these models throughout his philosophy.

Someone can ask why this connection between Socrates and Kierkegaard is still relevant in the world today. The relevance of Socrates and Kierkegaard philosophical tie in addressing the questions of the present-day world is indisputable. Today's world is full of complications like deep submersion of social relationships due to the pervasiveness of technology in every dimension of our life, global warming, migration from economically devastating regions and countries torn apart by terrorism and civil wars, and now extremism and populism. The modern world is in deep crisis for millions of people around the world. Life is becoming absurd! Thus, the relevance of Kierkegaard and Socrates in today's world is originated from this point of view. The modern world is changing rapidly with full of social and cultural contradictions.

Socrates' social and cultural contradictions with the Athenians is one of the issues of Socrates that fascinated Kierkegaard. Similarly, we are exposed to various kind of changes, which often led us to conflicts with traditional customs, practices, and dogmatism in today's world. Besides, the modern world suffers from the loss of moral innocence, lack of meaning for life, and the feeling of complete absurdity. There is a great feeling of alienation, hostility, and frustration with the ever-changing of social structures that clash with the traditional way of life.

Understanding the philosophy of Kierkegaard will help us to stand firmly with a philosophical and psychological weapon to resist all the confrontations that come due to the ever-changing modernity and the resulted social contradictions. Kierkegaard, with his Socratic teaching, is still relevant to this modern world. It gives us the reason to question the crisis of our time and the need to underst and appropriate truth for one's self. Currently, we are examining the purpose and meaning of this life and searching for ways to make it meaningful. The ideas of Kierkegaard which are modeled from Socrates, are still relevant to the modern man to have a virtuous life and an act of courage for demanding and conquering what belongs to him.
